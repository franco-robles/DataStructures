------------------------------------------

#### 1. Double Linked List.

##### info:
- Each node consists of a data value, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.
- Traversal can occur in both ways.
- It requires more space because of an extra pointer.
- It has multiple usages. It can be implemented on the stack, heap, and binary tree.

##### complexity:
 - Insertion Operation 
      1. Insert value at the front  O(1)
      2. Insert value at the end of the list O(1)
      3. Insert value after a specific node O(n). n = size list, because i need check if the node is present in the list
      4. delete a node from the doubly linked list O(n). delete is O(1) but check if the node is present is O(n)
