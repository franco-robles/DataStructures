------------------------------------------

#### 1. Double Linked List.

##### info:
- Each node consists of a data value, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.
- Traversal can occur in both ways.
- It requires more space because of an extra pointer.
- It has multiple usages. It can be implemented on the stack, heap, and binary tree.

##### Time Complexity: 
 - Insert value at the front  O(1)
 - Insert value at the end O(1)
 - Insert value after a specific node O(n). n = size , because i need check if the node is present in the list
 - Delete a node from the list O(n). delete a node is O(1), but check if it is present is O(n)
 - Search a node O(n)
 - Get size O(1)
